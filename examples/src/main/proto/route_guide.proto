// Interface exported by the server.
service RouteGuide {
  // A simple RPC.
  //
  // Obtains the feature at a given position.
  //
  // A feature with an empty name is returned if there's no feature at the given
  // position.

  // A server-to-client streaming RPC.
  //
  // Obtains the Features available within the given Rectangle.  Results are
  // streamed rather than returned at once (e.g. in a response message with a
  // repeated field), as the rectangle may cover a large area and contain a
  // huge number of features.

  // A client-to-server streaming RPC.
  //
  // Accepts a stream of Points on a route being traversed, returning a
  // RouteSummary when traversal is completed.

  // A Bidirectional streaming RPC.
  //
  // Accepts a stream of RouteNotes sent while a route is being traversed,
  // while receiving other RouteNotes (e.g. from other users).
}

// Points are represented as latitude-longitude pairs in the E7 representation
// (degrees multiplied by 10**7 and rounded to the nearest integer).
// Latitudes should be in the range +/- 90 degrees and longitude should be in
// the range +/- 180 degrees (inclusive).


// A latitude-longitude rectangle, represented as two diagonally opposite
// points "lo" and "hi".
  // One corner of the rectangle.
  // The other corner of the rectangle.


// A feature names something at a given point.
//
// If a feature could not be named, the name is empty.
  // The name of the feature.
  // The point where the feature is detected.


// Not used in the RPC.  Instead, this is here for the form serialized to disk.


// A RouteNote is a message sent while at a given point.
  // The location from which the message is sent.
  // The message to be sent.


// A RouteSummary is received in response to a RecordRoute rpc.
//
// It contains the number of individual points received, the number of
// detected features, and the total distance covered as the cumulative sum of
// the distance between each point.
  // The number of points received.
  // The number of known features passed while traversing the route.
  // The distance covered in metres.
  // The duration of the traversal in seconds.
